## Number Guess

First, the program should generate a random number, initially from 1 to 100. Then, the player will be promted to enter the right number which was generated before. Is the entered number unequal the generated number, a correspoding message should appear. Is the guessed number right, the programm will output this as message and terminates itself. After 10 failed attempts, the program will exit even though.

Requirements:
- The number of available attempts is pre-defined
- The programm will exit after the defined ammount of attempts or the successful guess of the numer

**Optional Additional Tasks**
- You can chose the range of numbers where the number to guess will be generated in
- After a definedn umber of failed attempts, the player will get a hint like: '*The number is between 5 and 15.*'
